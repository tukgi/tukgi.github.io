	<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
		Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that emphasizes kicking techniques, but also includes hand strikes, blocking, and other defensive techniques. The name "taekwondo" translates to "the way of the foot and fist," which reflects the focus on using the legs and feet as powerful weapons.

Taekwondo is practiced by people of all ages and skill levels, from children to adults, and is a popular form of martial arts for self-defense, sport, and fitness. It emphasizes discipline, self-control, and respect for others, and has become an Olympic sport since 2000. Taekwondo also includes forms (poomsae), sparring (kyorugi), and breaking (gyeokpa) as part of its training curriculum.
	</p>
<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align:justify;">
	A belt in Taekwondo is a symbol of a practitioner's rank and proficiency in the martial art. In Taekwondo, there are several belt colors, and each color represents a different level of proficiency. The order of the belt colors and their associated levels of proficiency can vary depending on the specific Taekwondo school or organization.

In general, the progression of belt colors in Taekwondo starts with white, followed by yellow, green, blue, red, and then black. It is common for students to progress through several levels of the same color belt before advancing to the next color.

To earn a belt in Taekwondo, a student must demonstrate proficiency in various techniques, including strikes, kicks, blocks, and forms, as well as show discipline, respect, and dedication to the practice. Each school or organization may have specific requirements for each belt rank, so it is essential to check with your instructor to understand what is expected of you at each level.

</p>
<center><h2 style="color: aliceblue;"> BELT COLOR MEANINGS </h2></center>
<p style="color:blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
	When you visit a Taekwon-Do dojang, or participate in a taekwondo class for the first time, you will notice that the belt colour of the students will be different. The belt color signifies each students level of training and proficiency.<br>
In order to progress to the next belt colour, the student need to undergo a physical test (<a href="https://www.itftaekwondo.com/itf-events/itf-gradings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITF Grading</a>), which becomes increasingly more complex and difficult as they progress to higher ranks.

<h2 style="color:white;"> WHITE BELT</h2>
<img src="/whitebelt.jpeg">
	<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align:justify;">White : Signifies innocence. No previous knowledge of Taekwon-Do, as that of a beginner student.

This belt normally comes with the dobok, and no test is required to wear a white belt. It is the equivalent of ‘L-plates’ for a driver.
The white belt represents purity and innocence, and the beginning of the student's journey in Taekwondo. At this level, the student learns the basic techniques, stances, and forms of Taekwondo, as well as the etiquette and philosophy of the martial art.

As the student progresses and gains proficiency in the fundamental skills, they can advance to higher ranks and different colored belts, symbolizing their increasing knowledge, skills, and mastery of the art.
</p>

<center>
<h2 style="color:yellow;"> YELLOW BELT</h2>
<img src="/yellowbelt.jpeg">
<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
	Yellow : Signifies the earth from which a plant sprouts and takes root as the foundation of Taekwon-Do is being laid.
	In Taekwondo, the yellow belt is usually the second rank, indicating that the student has progressed beyond the beginner level. Yellow signifies the earth from which a plant sprouts and takes root, symbolizing the student's growth and development in their Taekwondo journey.

At this level, students typically learn more complex techniques, including a variety of kicks, blocks, strikes, and combinations. They also begin to develop their sparring skills and continue to work on their poomsae (forms), which are predetermined sequences of movements that simulate self-defense situations.

Overall, the yellow belt is an important milestone in a Taekwondo student's progression, representing their dedication and commitment to the art.

<center>
	<h2 style="color:green;"> GREEN BELT</h2>
<img src="/greenbelt.jpeg">
<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
	Green : Signifies the plants growth as the Taekwon-Do skills begin to develop.
	In Taekwondo, the green belt typically signifies the level of an intermediate student who has made significant progress in learning the fundamental techniques and principles of Taekwondo.

To reach the green belt level, a student must have already earned the white, yellow, and green stripe belts, demonstrating proficiency in basic kicks, strikes, blocks, and forms. At the green belt level, students continue to refine and improve their techniques while also learning more advanced forms and sparring drills.

Green belt students are also expected to begin developing their leadership skills and to assist lower-ranking students in their training. They are considered to be halfway through the Taekwondo journey and are approaching the more advanced levels of the martial art.

<center>
<h2 style="color:darkblue;"> BLUE BELT</h2>
<img src="/bluebelt.jpeg">
<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
	Blue : Signifies the sky and the heavens, towards which the tree grows as Taekwon-Do training progresses.
	In Taekwondo, the blue belt signifies an intermediate level of skill and knowledge. It is typically awarded to students who have successfully passed the beginner level and demonstrated proficiency in the fundamental techniques, forms (patterns), sparring (free-style fighting), and basic self-defense techniques.

In most Taekwondo schools, the blue belt is the fourth belt color that a student can earn, usually following the white, yellow, and green belts. The requirements for earning a blue belt can vary depending on the school and the style of Taekwondo being taught, but generally, it involves mastering more advanced techniques, including jumping kicks, combination kicks, and more complex forms.

Earning a blue belt in Taekwondo is a significant achievement and a demonstration of a student's commitment and dedication to the martial art. It is also an indication that the student is making steady progress towards becoming a more skilled and well-rounded martial artist.

<h2 style="color:red;"> RED BELT</h2>
<img src="/redbelt.jpeg">
	<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
		Red : Signifies danger, cautioning the student to exercise control, and warning an opponent to stay away.
		In Taekwondo, a red belt typically signifies an intermediate level of proficiency in the martial art.

In some schools or organizations, the red belt is the final belt before reaching the rank of black belt. However, in other schools, there may be additional degrees or levels of red belt before a practitioner can progress to black belt.

The specific requirements and expectations for red belt may vary depending on the school or organization. In general, a red belt practitioner is expected to have a solid foundation of the fundamental techniques and principles of Taekwondo, as well as a deeper understanding of advanced techniques and strategies. They are also expected to demonstrate a high level of physical fitness, mental discipline, and leadership skills.

<h2 style="color:grey;"> BLACK BELT</h2>
<img src="/blackbelt.jpeg">      
	<p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
		Black : The opposite of white, therefore signifying a maturity and proficiency in Taekwon-Do and the holder’s imperviousness to darkness and fear.
		In Taekwondo, a black belt signifies a high level of mastery and proficiency in the art. It is the highest rank achievable and requires years of dedicated practice, training, and commitment. A black belt holder is considered an expert in the art and is expected to demonstrate exceptional technique, skill, and knowledge in all aspects of Taekwondo.

To achieve a black belt in Taekwondo, a student must progress through several lower-ranked belts, each requiring proficiency in specific techniques and forms. The black belt is typically divided into several degrees or dans, with each level indicating a higher level of proficiency and expertise. The highest degree in Taekwondo is the 10th-degree black belt, which is awarded only to the most exceptional practitioners who have dedicated their lives to the art.
