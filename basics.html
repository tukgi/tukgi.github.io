	<h1>Fundamental Taekwondo Techniques</h1><br>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">“If you want to grow high, you need to build a strong foundation”. Bad technique habits will hold you back on your Taekwondo journey and can be very difficult to break once they become ingrained. Here are some of the little things that are important to bear in mind during class so that you are able to become a strong and competent black belt.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Holding the fist (Jumok)</h3>
	<img src="C:\Users\Ramne\Downloads\Screenshot 2023-04-13 125646.png" alt="image">
	<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very common for white belts to forget about holding a tight fist (fig A). Obviously without one, punching and blocking techniques will be very ineffective and there will also be a distinct possibility of injuring the fingers, knuckles or wrist during practice. Usually, new students forget about locking the thumb over their clenched fingers (fig B).</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Knife hand (Sonnal)</h3>
	<img src="C:\Users\Ramne\Downloads\Screenshot 2023-04-13 125612.png" alt="image">
	<p style="text-align: justify;">1) Slightly bend the middle and ring fingers so that they are exactly the same length as the index finger which is held rigidly (A). Bear in mind that this will take a fair bit of conditioning and practise to perfect. 2) Bend the thumb so that the fleshy part before the first joint is resting on top of the index finger (B). 3) When the hand is in this position tense the hand. Then the fleshy part of the hand between the little finger and the wrist (directly opposite the thumb) becomes tense (C). This is the area that makes contact during the knife hand strike or block.</p>

	<h3>Horse riding Stance (Joo-chum Sohgi)</h3>
	<img src="C:\Users\Ramne\Downloads\Screenshot 2023-04-13 125704.png" alt="image">
	<p style="text-align: justify;">The horse riding stance lowers your centre of gravity. This is why it is critical to ensure that you develop a strong and accurate horse riding stance as it makes you stable and more difficult to be knocked over. One major problem beginners have with horse riding stance is that they have their feet either too close together or far too wide. Ideally, the feet should be one and a half to two shoulder widths apart. Also, a lot of beginners experience difficulty because they feel the strain of bending their knees on the quad muscles so in order to gain relief they tend to straighten their legs. Another critical aspect of the horse riding stance is to ensure that your feet are parallel and directly below your knees. If this is not achieved your bodyweight can put sideways pressure on your knees which can easily strain your knee joint - or worse.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Forward Stance (Ap Gubi)</h3>
	<img src="C:\Users\Ramne\Downloads\Screenshot 2023-04-13 125725.png" alt="image">
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Forward stance is critical in the execution of form moves such as Poomsei, one step sparring, basic movements and self defence because it allows you to transfer your body weight forward which generates power into your hand strikes, blocks and punches. To find an accurate right forward stance, stand with your feet one shoulder width apart with your feet parallel (Narrani Sohgi). From here, move the right foot one step forward then another. Then bend the right knee - this is vital as it helps protect the knee joint in the advent of it being kicked. The toes of the left foot move slightly to the left side. The most common mistakes are: 1) To have the rear toes pointing to the side too much which has the effect of twisting your hips away from being aligned with the shoulders (fig A). 2) Not bending the front knee (fig A). 3) Not having the feet shoulder width apart (fig A). 4) Lifting the back heel off the ground (fig B). 5) Not keeping the back knee straight (fig B). A correct forward stance is when the feet are shoulder width apart in a way that is like standing on imaginary ‘railway tracks’. </p>
