	<h1>SELF-DEFENSE</h1>
	<p style="color:blanchedalmond;text-align: justify;">
		Self-defense refers to the use of physical or mental techniques to protect oneself or others from harm or danger. It can involve various forms of S arts, combat sports, or other defensive techniques that are designed to enable a person to defend themselves against an attacker or aggressor.

		The concept of self-defense is based on the legal principle of the right to defend oneself or others from harm, using reasonable force as necessary. However, the extent and nature of self-defense can vary depending on the situation and local laws.

		Self-defense training can also teach you how to avoid dangerous situations, how to recognize potential threats, and how to respond appropriately in a crisis. Remember that prevention is always the best approach, and avoiding dangerous situations is often the most effective way to protect yourself from harm.<br>

	<p style="color:blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
		It is important to note that the effectiveness of each self-defense technique depends on the situation, the attacker, and the individual's level of skill and training. It is recommended that individuals seek proper training and practice to ensure their safety in potentially dangerous situations.
	</p>
	<p style="color:blanchedalmond; text-align:justify;">
		There are many different self-defense moves that you can learn to protect yourself from an attacker. Here are some common ones:
	</p>
		
		<p>
		<ul style="color:blanchedalmond; text-align: justify;">
			<li> Punch: A straight punch can be an effective self-defense move if executed correctly. Make a fist with your dominant hand and aim for the attacker's face or chest.</li>
			<li> Kick: A well-placed kick can incapacitate an attacker, giving you time to get away. Aim for the attacker's groin, shin, or knee.</li>
			<li> Knee Strike: If an attacker is close, you can use a knee strike to the groin, stomach or chest to fend them off.</li>
			<li> Elbow Strike: If an attacker grabs you, you can use an elbow strike to hit them in the face, nose or other vulnerable areas.</li>
			<li> Palm Heel Strike: A palm heel strike can be effective for close-quarters self-defense. Hit the attacker's nose, chin or throat with the heel of your hand.</li>
			<li> Arm Lock: If an attacker grabs your arm, you can use an arm lock to twist it and break their grip.</li>
			<li> Leg Sweep: A leg sweep can be used to knock an attacker off their feet, giving you time to get away.</li>
			<li> Chokehold Escape: If an attacker puts you in a chokehold, you can use various techniques to escape. One option is to turn your chin toward the attacker's elbow and use your arm to push against their elbow, creating enough space for you to breathe.</li>
			<li> Defense Against Weapons: You can also learn self-defense techniques for defending against weapons like knives, guns, or sticks. These techniques can include disarming the attacker or using an object as a shield.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p style="color:blanchedalmond; text-align:justify;">
	It's important to remember that self-defense moves should only be used as a last resort in a dangerous situation. The best way to stay safe is to avoid dangerous situations altogether and practice awareness and prevention techniques.
